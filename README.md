## WHAT IS CSS?

- For changing the **color** (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).
- For changing **size of headings and links** (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size). 
- To create a **layout** — for example, *turning a single column of text into a layout* with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Column_layouts).  
- It can even be used for **effects such as animation** (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations).

### HOW TO INSERT CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

1. External CSS: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page: Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section. Example : <!DOCTYPE html>
